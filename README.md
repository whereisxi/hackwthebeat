# hackwthebeat

This is our hack with the beat project. (Xi Chen, James Williams)

What is it?:
  - it is a virtual piano which covers a single octive.

How do use it?:
  - You can click on the keys using your mouse
  - You can press keys on your keyboard to also activate the kays
  - The keyboard keys are:
    - q = C
    - 2 = C#
    - w = D
    - 3 = D#
    - e = E
    - r = F
    - 5 = F#
    - t = G
    - 6 = G#
    - y = A
    - 7 = A#
    - u = B

This is our first time working with html,css,js. We learnt them just for this hackathon with very little preperation but did end up making something which works.
